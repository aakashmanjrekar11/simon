### ðŸš€ [Live Demo](https://aakashmanjrekar11.github.io/simon/)

- The game has four coloured buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the computer and the player. 
- A round in the game consists of the computer lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. 
- As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
